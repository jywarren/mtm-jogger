mtm-jogger
====

Sends keyboard jog commands to a pygestalt virtual machine, for example to control a motor. 

The mtm-jogger module can be loaded into the http://mods.cba.mit.edu environment. The jogger has a keyboard box that listens to the arrowkey and page up and down keystrokes, and will send moves to a http://github.com/nadya/pygestalt machine. To do this, the node code mtm-fabserver needs to be run on the computer that is connected to the pygestalt machine. You also need to install pygestalt.

This is part of the Machines that Make project. You can see more at http://mtm.cba.mit.edu.
